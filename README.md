## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, Media Queries, Advanced Selectors)

## How It Works

- Categories are filtered using CSS selectors like `:checked`, `:not()`, and `:nth-child()`.
- The sidebar automatically adjusts position (left on desktop, top on mobile).
- The product grid adapts responsively (4 per row on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile).
